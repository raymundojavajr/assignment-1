# ML Project: Testing the Organization of MLOps

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project. The goal is to demonstrate how to structure and organize an ML project following MLOps practices. This includes proper separation of concerns, usage of logging, saving and loading models, and preparing a clear project structure.

## Project Overview

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict outcomes based on a dataset, specifically focusing on data classification. It covers various aspects of MLOps, including:

- **Model Training**: Training a logistic regression model.
- **Model Saving and Loading**: Using joblib to save and load the model.
- **Logging**: Capturing the training process using logs for better traceability.
- **Directory Structure**: Organizing the code and files into appropriate directories for better maintainability and scalability.
